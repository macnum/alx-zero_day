# Git
## 1. Repo-session
>    Create a new directory called `0x03-git` in your `alx-zero_day` repo.
    Make sure you include a not empty `README.md` in your directory:
    at the root of your repository `alx-zero_day`
    AND in the directory `0x03-git`
    And important part: **Make sure your commit and push your code to Github - otherwise the Checker will always fail.**

## 2. Coding fury road
>   For the moment we have an empty project directory containing only a `README.md`. It’s time to code!

   - Create these directories at the root of your project:` bash`, `c`, `js`
    - Create these empty files:
        - `c/c_is_fun.c`
        - `js/main.js`
        - `js/index.js`
    - Create a file `bash/alx` with these two lines inside: `#!/bin/bash` and `echo "ALX"`
    - Create a file bash/school with these two lines inside: `#!/bin/bash` and `echo "School"`
    - Add all these new files to git
    - Commit your changes (message: “Starting to code today, so cool”) and push to the remote server
